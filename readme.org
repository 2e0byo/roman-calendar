#+title: Roman calendar in python

Script to calculate today’s date according to the roman way of naming
the days.  (Note that this is not the same thing as the Julian
calendar, and that ‘roman dating’ is a rather fraught business.)

Implemented as a challenge and for the fun of it.

* Usage
#+begin_src python
  from roman_date import roman_date
  from datetime import date
  print(roman_date(date.today()))
#+end_src

* Tests
#+begin_src bash
  pytest roman_date.py
#+end_src

* Practical Usage
Modify ~roman_date~ to spew out whatever format you want, save it to a
dict or csv or json or something, and use that.

The test dataset is ‘off the net’.  It has been corrected.  Whilst the
original format might have been copyrighted, it is impossible to
copyright the names of the days themselves, or their standard
abbreviated form, which is all we use here.
